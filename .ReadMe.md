# GitHub Commands

## What is Git and Why Do We Need It?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time, keeps a history of every change, and makes it easy to collaborate and revert to previous versions if needed.

**Key Benefits:**
- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work together.
- History: Track every change and revert if necessary.
- Branching: Experiment with new features safely.
- Distributed: Every user has a full copy of the repository.

## Common Git Commands

| Command                | Description & Usage                                                                 |

| `git log`              | Shows the commit history.                                                          |
| `git diff`             | Shows differences between files or commits.                                        |
| `git branch`           | Lists, creates, or deletes branches.                                               |

| `git merge <branch>`   | Merges changes from another branch into the current branch.                        |
| `git pull`             | Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.                             |
| `git push`             | Uploads local commits to the remote repository.                                    |
| `git remote -v`        | Shows remote repository URLs.                                                      |
| `git rm <file>`        | Removes a file from the working directory and stages the removal.                  |

## How Git Works (Diagram)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Working Directory] --> B[Staging Area]
    B --> C[Local Repository]
    C --> D[Remote Repository]
    A -.->|git add| B
    B -.->|git commit| C
    C -.->|git push| D
    D -.->|git pull| C
```

**Explanation:**
- **Working Directory:** Where you edit files.
- **Staging Area:** Where you prepare files for commit (`git add`).
- **Local Repository:** Where commits are stored locally (`git commit`).
- **Remote Repository:** Central server (e.g., GitHub) for collaboration (`git push`/`git pull`).

## Summary

Git helps teams manage code changes efficiently, supports branching and merging, and provides a robust history of all modifications. It is essential for modern software development and collaboration.
